# Challenge-2-Professional-Portfolio

## Description
This is my first developer portfolio. The portfolio contains a header with working navigation links, a hero section with a headshot, a projects section with links to other project repositories on my GitHub account, an About Me section, a Contact section, and a footer. All of it is designed to responsively adjust to various viewports.
